            <h2>Persian cat: origins and history</h2><hr>
              <p>The Persian is an old breed. To those who love this elegant cat, it will come as no surprise that the longhaired beauty originated in the cradle of civilization: Mesopotamia, which was later known as Persia and is now modern-day Iran. The breed's long hair was probably the result of a natural mutation, and its striking appearance attracted the attention of 17th-century italian nobleman and world traveler Pietro Della Valle, who is credited with bringing the first longhaired cats to Europe in 1626. Initially the Persian cat was called a French cat and it was quite different from the pet we know now. Then, there were a variety of smaller and cudlier cats with longer fur imported from Iran. From then on the cats were selective breeded which resulted in the appearance of todays Persian cat.</p>
              <p>This breed was highly appreciated during the Victorian Age because the Queen Victory, of course, had some blue-colored specimens so all royals and wealthy merchants wanted the same. After the grey Persian era, the white blue-eyed cats, felines with white mantle and orange or light colour were also popular.</p>
              <p>After the white, came the black Persian cat, rather well-liked and widespread, while the Persian Red Cat has experienced a problem in getting the uniform tint over the years. Other colors as chocolate, silver and lilac, are recent.</p>

          <h2>Persian cat: character</h2><hr>
          <p>The character of the Persian cat can not be perceived by his behavior that appears aristocratic and phlegmatic. To a person seeing the cat from far it might look like it is only a sweet peaceful pet with nothing more than a stench under its nose, yet indeed, it is an eternal child. The Persian cat is one of the best cats to keep a company to older people and children. The people who desires typical independence of feline mixed with a sense of attachment.</p>
          <p>Affectionate, balanced and quiet, the Persian cat is hardly a prey to stress or anxiety. It does not require larger space than sofa, armchair and bed if you let your pet to “occupy” it. Most of the time you will find your ball off fluff cuddeled on one of the soft surfaces in your house, but, from time to time, the inner child emerges in this cat and it starts to look for a game. Persians are qiute a compelled but discriminating cats so usually they look for their master to play with. Otherwise it will find some toys of its own, but no danger in that. Though they are lively players, there is no Persian cat that creates huge disasters. It usually does not pose a threat to your precious ornaments in the living room or shred your armchair in pieces: it does play but is not a domestic hurricane.</p>

        <h2>Persian cat: helth and care</h2><hr>
        <p>The biggest issue when it comes to grooming a Persian cat is its fur. The coat of Persian has to be brushed every day to keep it shiny, vibrant and to avoid it getting tangelled in nasty fur dreads. The cat has other issue when it comes to long fur. Wgen a cat grooms itself, it ingests some of the hair which leads to the furball formation in the stomach. It is difficult for cats digestion system to get rid of all the fur so it is quite common that Persians suffer from intestinal occlusion. To help your cats organism to deal with furballs you should use special pasta once a week which dissolves fur in digestion system.</p>
        <p>Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Although they are beautiful and sweet, Persians are prone to a number of potential health problems, most commonly related to their facial structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breathing difficulty or noisy breathing caused by constricted nostrils</li>
          <li>Dental malocclusions, meaning the teeth don’t mesh well together</li>
          <li>Eye conditions such as cherry eye and entropion</li>
          <li>Polycystic kidney disease, for which a genetic test is available</li>
          <li>Predisposition toringworm, a fungal infection</li>
          <li>Seborrhea oleosa, a skin condition that causes itchiness, redness and hair loss</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If well maintained a Persian cat can reach 15 years in average lifespan. However there are some which can live close to 20 years.</p>
